Introduction
************

In this world of growing technologies everything is cloud based or going to be. To cope with this
flow we always need to learn the latest technologies. To gain programming knowledge, learning
algorithms, data structures and attending programming contests is a good option. Every
university around the country organizes intra university programming contests and trains the
teams and organizes Q&A sessions often to improve the knowledge of programmers. We saw
that many universities do all these jobs in paperwork or in facebook groups which we thought
were disarranged. So, we introduced the CPC tool which can be used to see all the historical
ranks of different national contests, progress of individual programmers, creating and managing
teams, giving tasks to individuals or groups, chat with team members, write blog about
algorithm, data-structures, seeking answers of question and many more. In this tool, we made
distinct roles for users, mentors and coaches. We also introduced programmers leaderboard with
a custom rating for all the programmers which can give anyone an overview about the skill level
of a programmer.

We believe this tool can be used by coaches/mentors to do all the managing tasks more
efficiently.

Project Scope
*************

Our project aims at efficiency for the job of coaches and mentors. It will help them
understand the overall improvement of individual programmers more efficiently. It also
makes creating and managing teams/groups easier. With this tool every task becomes
more organized than before. This project aims at overall improvement of both
programmers and faculty members of universities.

Limitatin
*********
-  Some features of this tool are dependent on other websites like codeforces, codechef, uva etc. So any problems on those websites can also affect the performance of our tool
-  Requires internet connection for using this project as it is a web based application.
-  Sufficient bandwidth and hosting space will be required for implementing the system.

**Database:** MySQL

****************
Developer's Word
****************

We have tried our best to make this system user friendly as well as usable. Coaches and
mentors can easily monitor the works done by programmers. They can easily give tasks
to the programmers and view necessary information through this. This system is designed
to make the jobs of coaches and mentors easier. The system is developed under
responsive framework and upgraded technologies so that the system can run from any
devices like PC, Laptop, and Mobile etc. We have tried our best to make this project
cost-effective and flexible. During development of the software all phases have been
completed carefully. So this project is still under modification. Future upgrading and
enhancement will be continued to keep the system up to date.
